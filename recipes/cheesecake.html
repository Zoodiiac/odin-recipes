        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This lemon cheese cake recipe isn't made with cheese — it is a layer cake that's filled with a tangy homemade lemon curd (which is another name for lemon cheese). If you like, use your favorite scratch recipe for the cake, but I usually like to simplify all I can.</p>


        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 (3.5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons grated lemon zest</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9-inch round cake pans.

            </li>
            <li>Mix together cake mix, milk, instant vanilla pudding, 3 whole eggs, and oil in a large bowl. Pour batter into the prepared pans.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of cakes comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Set aside cakes on wire racks to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Combine sugar, butter, lemon juice, 6 egg yolks, flour, and lemon zest in the top half of a double boiler. Cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until mixture is thick enough to spread. Remove from heat and allow lemon curd to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Run a knife around the edges of the cake pans. Invert cakes; spread cooled lemon curd between cake layers.</li>
        </ol>
